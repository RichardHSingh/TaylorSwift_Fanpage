# TaylorSwift_Fanpage

In order to attain a passing grade in my Web Development papers at Techtorium, I had to create a make belief fan page for Taylor Swift. 
This project is 1 of 3 projects one had to produce and fill in all requirements. I got to learn how a Gnatt chart works with use of waterfall methodology.
